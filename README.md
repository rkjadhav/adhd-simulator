🧠 ADHD Simulator (Web Game)
A simple text-based web game that simulates the experience of trying to stay focused with ADHD.

🎮 How to Play
Your Focus Meter keeps draining.

Random Distractions will pop up (social media, intrusive thoughts, cravings, etc.).

You’ll get choices like:

Ignore distraction

Take a short break

Give in to dopamine

Resisting distractions keeps your focus alive.

Giving in feels good but hurts your focus.

Emotional states (frustration, boredom) will make it harder as you go.

Goal:
Stay focused and finish your task.
